# Recipe_app
The Recipe app keeps track of all your recipes, ingredients, and inventory. It allows users to save ingredients, keep track of what they have, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on what they have and what they are missing from a recipe. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking the app allows users to access them.
